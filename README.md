# Update
This project is continued in [animation library](https://github.com/dChancellor/animation-library). I would like to keep this around, because the animation on this bounce is snappier than the one found in the animation library and want to keep this for reference/posterity. 

Am archiving as of 1/4/2023, however as any changes to this should really be done in the above mentioned animation library.

# README
Find the compiled javascript file in /build/bounce.js. An implementation example can be found in /example. Make sure to import the script as a module. 

Expected props for future bounce out animation: 

* [ ] bounce height

* [ ] dip height

* [ ] rise height

* [ ] fall speed

* [ ] hangtime

* [ ] bounce speed
